# Examples of unit tests using Jasmine
### The purpose of this repository is to learn unit testing with jasmine by looking at some working examples. Once the examples start making sense you can add a few of your own examples and create a pull request.

## Setup
You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed

Clone this repository using: </br>
`git clone https://github.com/MelroyNoronha/jasmine-examples.git` </br>
or simply download the zip using this [link](https://github.com/MelroyNoronha/jasmine-examples/archive/master.zip).

Open a terminal in the `jasmine-examples` directory and run: </br>
`npm install`

## Running the tests
You should now be able to run: </br>
`jasmine` </br>
This will run all the unit tests defined in `spec/example.spec.js`

## Adding your own tests
Create a file in the `jasmine-examples` directory with the following naming scheme: </br>
`name-example.js` (replace 'name' with your name) </br>
This file is for the code that you would like to test.

Create a file in the `spec` directory with the following naming scheme: </br>
`name-example.spec.js` </br>
This file is for defining the tests for the code in `name-example.js`.
